## Research Experience
Research Mentor: Dr. T.P. Sharma, Associate Professor, National Institute of Technology Hamirpur

* **Device Classification Based Data Encryption for Internet of Things** _(Aug. 2018 - Jun. 2019)_<br>
	* Classified devices into various classes, based on their computational and communication capabilities and proposed Class-specific data encryption/decryption techniques for heterogeneous IoT devices.<br>
	* Different schemes for data encryption are proposed at different levels of interconnection across devices of various classes.<br>
	* Simulation experiments reveal significant improvements in the solution of encryption techniques for given scenarios.<br><br>

* **Lightweight Encryption Algorithms, Technologies, and Architectures in Internet of Things: A Survey** _(Aug. 2018 - Jun. 2019)_<br>
	* The paper provides an overview of IoT along with presenting various privacy and security-related issues, and the differences between the security in IoT, and the security in conventional systems.<br>
	* Different lightweight encryption techniques for IoT, Limitations in IoT, IoT technologies, and architectures are discussed and compared in the paper.<br><br>

* **Theoretical Analysis on Client-Server Interaction** _(Aug. 2017 - Jan. 2018)_<br>
_Research Collaborators: Rishabh, Akhilesh Kumar, Rahul Kumar, Gourav Sisodiya_<br>
	* The paper discusses various types of client-server architectures, along with explaining different related terminologies along with presenting numerous related security concerns.
	* It discusses the mobile agents and the security concerns related to them and the different applications of client-server interactions, along with discussing the current trends.<br>

## Development Experience
* **Software Engineer:**
	* **Botson Labs Pvt Ltd.** _(September 2021, April 2022)_
		* Designed and developed various features (for web application) and solutions, to enhance the user experience and usability.
		* Developed and Optimized various internal tools to improve the accuracy hence quality of the solutions provided to the customers.
		* Optimized the web app (backend and queries) and reduced page loading time.
		* Optimized various existing solutions and made them work more than 10X faster.<br><br>

* **Google Summer of Code** _(2018, 2019)_
	* **Libreswan Opportunistic IPsec using Let‚Äôs Encrypt:** Created shell scripts for establishing the Opportunistic Encryption connection using Libreswan IPsec. It also generates client/server configurations and updates and imports the certificates automatically along with handling files safely. Server/Client crashes handled. The project makes the process of using OE easier, automated and over 10 times faster than the manual procedure.
	* **Libreswan Managing Interface:** Developed Application for generating & signing CA root certificates & user certificates (VPN connection profiles) along with generating custom configurations for user certificates. Automatic creating and updating of certificate revocation list implemented. The project increased the efficiency of performing all the above tasks by over 7 times as compared to the existing manual procedure.<br><br>

* **Internships at NIT Hamirpur** _(Summer 2018, 2017)_<br>
	* **Elective manager:** Built an application for the online allotment of various UG/PG electives, which are allotted based on CGPA, elective priority & available seats. The software has an auto backup mechanism and is using SQL procedures for performing various tasks. The project has proved to be over 15 times faster than the existing system (manual).
	* **Training and placement portal:** Developed Official website - Office of Training and Placement NIT Hamirpur. It eases the process of finding the relevant info regarding the Placement cell and helps with the process when visiting the Institute for placements. The project has turned out to be over 10 times faster than the existing procedure.
