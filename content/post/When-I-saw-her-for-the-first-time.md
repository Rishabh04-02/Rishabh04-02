**When I saw her for the first time,**

**She was wearing a white dress with a glittering shine.**

**She walked down the stairs with a flower in hand,**

**And eyes started rolling on her with an ovational stand.**

**She was a princess with a pleasant smile,**

**Which can even cure a wounded soldier in a while.**

**She was a perfect partner as I wanted but I can’t take her as for granted,**

**She was perfect but not was I,**

**That’s why I said her a very good bye**

**A very good bye.......**
