<center><b>
As the sunshine kissed the flowers,<br>
butterflies come searching for their powers.<br><br>
With thousands of tulip’s, lilies and roses,<br>
there is a little flower that dozes.<br><br>
The flowers are shining bright for the swarm,<br>
but the little one is not feeling warm.<br><br>
Incredible is the scent of the flowers,<br>
whereas, the little one is still recovering from the showers.<br><br>
As the beautiful butterflies are nearing,<br>
all the flowers seems to be cheering,<br>
but the little one is feeling blues,<br>
as he is not in their views.<br><br>
Will he be chosen or be left in the dark?<br>
Only time will tell if any butterfly feels the spark.<br><br>
</b></center>
