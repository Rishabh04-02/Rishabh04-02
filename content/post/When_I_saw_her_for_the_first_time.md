<center><b>
When I saw her for the first time,<br>
She was wearing a white dress with a glittering shine.<br><br>
She walked down the stairs with a flower in hand,<br>
And eyes started rolling on her with an ovational stand.<br><br>
She was a princess with a pleasant smile,<br>
Which can even cure a wounded soldier in a while.<br><br>
She was a perfect partner as I wanted,<br>
but I can’t take her as for granted,<br><br>
She was perfect but not was I,<br>
That’s why I said her a very good bye<br>
A very good bye.......
