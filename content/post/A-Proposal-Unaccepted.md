<center><b>
Loving a girl was pretty fine,<br>
As it gave me an experience like drinking wine.<br><br>
She was like a princess and I was like a slave,<br>
And falling for her may be leading me to my grave.<br><br>
Even though I proposed her as I loved her a lot,<br>
To which she even does not give a second thought.<br><br>
She started ignoring me as like I am a rotten apple,<br>
To which I thought to respect her decision and not to grapple.<br><br>
Still being ignored, maybe this is the end of my story,<br>
Or maybe this is the beginning of my journey,<br>
Of making some unforgettable memory.
