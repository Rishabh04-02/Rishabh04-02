**Loving a girl was pretty fine,**

**As it gave me an experience like drinking wine.**

**She was like a princess and I was like a slave,**

**And falling for her may be leading me to my grave.**

**Even though I proposed her as I loved her a lot,**

**To which she even does not give a second thought.**

**She started ignoring me as like I am a rotten apple,**

**To which I thought to respect her decision and not to grapple.**

**Still being ignored, maybe this is the end of my story,**

**Or maybe this is the beginning of my journey**

**Of making some unforgettable memory.**
