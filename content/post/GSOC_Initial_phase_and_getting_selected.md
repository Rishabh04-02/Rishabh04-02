Previous post - [GSOC - Selecting the project and organization](https://rishabhchaudhary.in/gsoc_selecting_the_project_and_organization/)

*Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do*. - Pele

As I've already chosen my project (Read the previous post), It was time to know it better and work for it.
So, I studied the details of the project form the organization wiki page and got an Idea of what this project is about. Believe me when I say I got an Idea, I just got an Idea and didn't understand most of the things. So, I mailed the project mentor asking more about the project. Then in response I got a mail describing everything in detail and after going through the mail several times the first thing I understood was that the project is not what the project title(*Web based certificate and Profile user interface*) shows, It is much more than that.

At first I thought that the project is about creating user profiles and then downloading some certificates. But after the detailed mail from the mentor I got to know that it is more about *Generating, Creating, Administrating, Validating, Authenticating, Automating, Revocating, and much more...* at this point I got a little scared and a lot nervous asking myself, *Will I be able to build something like this?* But the detailed description got me more interested into the project.
