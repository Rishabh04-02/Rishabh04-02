<center><b>
Being misunderstood has become a part of my life,<br>
people here will judge you on the base of strife.<br><br>
Life has changed a lot,<br>
like a growing money-plant in a pot.<br><br>
Once a happy soul,<br>
is now a hated ghoul.<br><br>
No, one wants to be in your shoes,<br>
but everyone wants to get you blues.<br><br>
Trying hard to find the meaning of life’s valley,<br>
but at every step being cheated by some ally.<br><br>
Still hopeful that someday they’ll understand my action,<br>
and will give me the deserved reactions.<br><br>
</b></center>
