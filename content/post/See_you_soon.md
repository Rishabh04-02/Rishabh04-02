*This Poem is dedicated to my dearest friend Pooja.*<br><br>
<b>
See you soon,<br>
even if that means passing through dunes.<br><br>
You are one of my dearest friends,<br>
for whom I pray, her happiness ascends.<br><br>
You are one of the finest persons in my life,<br>
whom I never want to see in strife.<br><br>
You are the one inspiring girl,<br>
who one day will surely shine like a pearl.<br><br>
</b></center>
