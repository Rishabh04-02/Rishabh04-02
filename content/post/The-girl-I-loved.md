<center><b>
The girl I loved the most,<br>
Left me at the coast.<br><br>
She said she don’t want to continue,<br>
To which shocked, I said k… I don’t want to burden you.<br><br>
She was happy I don’t know why,<br>
But for me it was hard to cry.<br><br>
</b></center>

<center><b>
The coast grew silent & so did I,<br>
But she was somehow smiling with joy,.<br><br>
The happy moments come to my mind,<br>
When I saw in her eyes who was never mine.<br><br>
And then she said a very good bye,<br>
To which I said but why, but why..<br><br>
And there she goes with her new boyfriend,<br>
And I was left at the coast with a wedding card in my hand.<br><br>

<center><b>
Completely broken I thought to jump & end my life in the endless sea..<br>
But then there comes god’s gift to me,<br>
My best friend who always wished for me.<br><br>
Who saved my life & made it clear,<br>
That no one in this world is perfect dear.<br><br>
And made me learn just one thing,<br>
That I’m the one for one just being.<br><br>
</b></center>
