**The girl I loved the most,**

**Left me at the coast,**

**She said she don’t want to continue,**

**To which shocked, I said k… I don’t want to burden you,**

**She was happy I don’t know why,**

**But for me it was hard to cry.**

_______________________________________


**The coast grew silent & so did I,**

**But she was somehow smiling with joy,**

**The happy moments come to my mind,**

**When I saw in her eyes who was never mine.**

**And then she said a very good bye,**

**To which I said but why, but why..**

**And there she goes with her new boyfriend,**

**And I was left at the coast with a wedding card in my hand.**

**Completely broken I thought to jump & end my life in the endless sea..**

___________________________________________


**But then there comes god’s gift to me,**

**My best friend who always wished for me.**

**Who saved my life & made it clear,**

**That no one in this world is perfect dear.**

**And made me learn just one thing,**

**That I’m the one for one just being.**
