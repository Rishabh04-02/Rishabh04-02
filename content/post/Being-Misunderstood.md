**Being misunderstood has become a part of my life,**

**people here will judge you on the base of strife.**

**Life has changed a lot,**

**like a growing money-plant in a pot.**

**Once a happy soul,**

**is now a hated ghoul.**

**No, one wants to be in your shoes,**

**but everyone wants to get you blues.**

**Trying hard to find the meaning of life’s valley,**

**but at every step being cheated by some ally.**

**Still hopeful that someday they’ll understand my action,**

**and will give me the deserved reactions.**
