>	GSoC 2018, Django 2.0, Python 3.5, MySQL, HTML-CSS  

### Background  
There   are   shell   scripts   for   creating   X.509   certificates,   revoking   certificates   and  signing   CRLs   and   scripts   for   the   creation   of   Profile   certificate   files   for   certain  devices   such   as   Linux,   Apple   OS   X,   Windows,   iOS,   etc.,   these   require   careful  specification   of   various   certificate   attributes   so   that   these   certificates   work   on   a  variety   of   devices:   Android,   Windows,   iOS/OSX,   Linux,   etc.   The   goal   of   this   project  is to gather all that knowledge into a simple interface. 
 
The interface supports the following: 

* Generating   the   proper   ipsec.conf   configuration   based   on   web   admin  interface including DNS/split-DNS configurations. 
* Allow Administrator to invite new users using email id. 
* A   new   user   after   account   validation   can   download   the   generated  certificate/profile (over TLS) for different platforms. 
* The   generated   certificates/profiles   can   only   be   downloaded   once,   through  the portal. 
* Admin   can   list,   revoke/disable   (temporary   revocation)   user  certificates/profiles. 
* Generate PKCS#12​ certificates for users. 
* Generate   iOS/OSX   ​ .mobileconfig   profiles   for   automatic   installation   on  iOS/OSX. 
* Ipsilon user authentication to web application. 
* Configure munin-node to work with libreswan plugin.

## 2. [Linux based secure systems manager](https://github.com/Colviz/Vince/)
>	Python, Sockets, GPG (GNU Privacy Guard), Linux, Broadcasting

## Background
This project is Developed and submitted (as Major Project II) in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of the degree of Bachelor of Technology and is the continuation of project: Agent using client server Interaction.

This project named Linux based secure systems manager, is an open source software. It allows the system administrator to perform various tasks on the client systems connected on a network with just firing a command eg. installation of softwares, upgrading system, shutting down the systems, which then performs/executes the desired tasks on all the systems. Also, it allows various users on a network/subnet to chat in a dedicated chat room. This software can easily adapt to large network of computers and works efficiently for small networks.

This software can be used in any computers connected to a single network with Linux as the operating system like a computer laboratory. The only constraint is that they all must run Linux as their operating system with python and Thefuck (package) installed along with few modules of python eg. python3-tkinter. The project uses the package Thefuck for error correction. The client scripts can be installed using !bangs in Linux.

Thefuck for error handling and error correction tries to match a rule for the previous command, creates a new command using the matched rule and runs the corrected command. Moreover, we can also create our own rule for the package and in that way it’ll become more effective and efficient according to our needs. Also the error correction package we are using is open source and hence is under rapid development phase and also its available for all available major operating systems.

>	Python, Sockets, Linux, Broadcasting

## Background
This project is Developed and submitted (as Major Project I) in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of the degree of Bachelor of Technology.

This project named “Agent using client server Interaction”, is an open source project. It will allow the system administrator to perform certain tasks on the client systems connected on a network with just firing a command, which will then perform the set of desired tasks on all the systems. This set of desired tasks can be anything ranging from installing a particular software on systems to downloading and executing some available script. This software can easily adapt to large network of computers and works efficiently for small networks.

This software can be used in any computers connected to a single network like a computer lab. The only constraint is that they all must run Linux based OS with python and Thefuck (package) installed. The project uses the package Thefuck for error handling and error correction. The client scripts can be installed using !bangs in Linux.

## 4. [Elective Manager](https://github.com/Rishabh04-02/Elective-manager)
>	PHP, MySQL, Javascript, HTML-CSS, Material Design						  

### Background
This project named Elective Manager, is an open source project. It will be used to allot the Elective subjects to undergraduate as well as post-graduate students. These elective subjects are published by the departments and are allotted to students based
on their priority of published subjects and CGPA. The system can adapt to a range of events from small scale to large scale.

Previously, the allotment of the elective subjects was done manually which was a very inconvenient method for the students as well as for the teachers. The allotment process was very chaotic and time consuming.
The Prime objective of this project is to automate the process of allotment thus allotting the elective subjects without chaos and in a more convenient manner to the people involved.

## 7. [Life Cycle](https://github.com/Rishabh04-02/Life-cycle)
>	C++, OpenGL, Graphics.h

### Background
This project aims at describing the life cycle of a common person with the help of a character named SUDO. In this project Sudo covers all the basic life experiences and changes which we humans encounter during our life cycle. If this project needs to
be categorized then the category under which it falls will be - A short film, but that in graphics mode and made with OpenGL.
OpenGL language is used in making of this project and it uses various advanced tools of Computer graphics. 

OpenGL - It’s the most powerful language available for Computer Graphics and to prove this statement we can see that all the operating systems runs on OpenGL to display their Graphics output and its by default installed in every OS so as to display Its GUI (graphical user interface).
