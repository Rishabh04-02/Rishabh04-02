As the sunshine kissed the flowers,<br>
butterflies come searching for their powers.

With thousands of tulipâ€™s, lilies and roses,<br>
there is a little flower that dozes.

The flowers are shining bright for the swarm,<br>
but the little one is not feeling warm.

Incredible is the scent of the flowers,<br>
whereas, the little one is still recovering from the showers.

As the beautiful butterflies are nearing,<br>
all the flowers seems to be cheering,<br>
but the little one is feeling blues,<br>
as he is not in their views.

Will he be chosen or be left in the dark?<br>
Only time will tell if any butterfly feels the spark.
