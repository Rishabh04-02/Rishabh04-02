The girl I loved the most,<br>
Left me at the coast.

She said she don’t want to continue,<br>
To which shocked, I said k… I don’t want to burden you.

She was happy I don’t know why,<br>
But for me it was hard to cry.

<br>

The coast grew silent & so did I,<br>
But she was somehow smiling with joy.

The happy moments come to my mind,<br>
When I saw in her eyes who was never mine.

And then she said a very good bye,<br>
To which I said but why, but why...

And there she goes with her new boyfriend,<br>
And I was left at the coast with a wedding card in my hand.

<br>

Completely broken I thought to jump & end my life in the endless sea...<br>
But then there comes god’s gift to me,<br>
My best friend who always wished for me.

Who saved my life & made it clear,<br>
That no one in this world is perfect dear.

And made me learn just one thing,<br>
That I’m the one for one just being.
