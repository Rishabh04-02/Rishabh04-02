See you soon,<br>
even if that means passing through dunes.

You are one of my dearest friends,<br>
for whom I pray, her happiness ascends.

You are one of the finest persons in my life,<br>
whom I never want to see in strife.

You are the one inspiring girl,<br>
who one day will surely shine like a pearl.
