Being misunderstood has become a part of my life,<br>
people here will judge you on the base of strife.

Life has changed a lot,<br>
like a growing money-plant in a pot.

Once a happy soul,<br>
is now a hated ghoul.

No, one wants to be in your shoes,<br>
but everyone wants to get you blues.

Trying hard to find the meaning of life’s valley,<br>
but at every step being cheated by some ally.

Still hopeful that someday they’ll understand my action,<br>
and will give me the deserved reactions.
