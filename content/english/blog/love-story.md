It all started with a pleasant smile,<br>
which left its imprint for a while.

Then came the part of introduction,<br>
which lasted longer than the usual deduction.

Our meetings started getting long and cosy,<br>
little did we know that it's going to be rosy.

The realization of it being love wasn't late,<br>
and for us, it was quite an elate.

With all this being told, let's see where it goes,<br>
hoping for it never to end, or come to blows.
