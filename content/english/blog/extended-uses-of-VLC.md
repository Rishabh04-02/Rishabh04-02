If its so then now its the time to start my story. So, let me tell you some advanced features of vlc which no other player has it all and that so for free. 

So let’s start with the features:


## **Video conversion**

Just go to media button and select convert/save from the list and a pop-up will appear which will ask you to select the file which you want to convert and it has over 20 formats which vary from mp3 to youtube HD in which the file can be converted. Its a feature which allows users to do conversion and that also without downloading any converter.


## **Screen capture/Desktop recording**

This feature of the player allows you to record your desktop screen, if you want to make a tutorial and post it on youtube then you can record your desktop without any difficulty and without downloading any extra software for the purpose. And believe me its desktop recording quality is superb if you do it between 25–30 fps.


## **Add-ons**

One can play any online video in the player and also the video available over network, just go to network streaming option in the player available under Media category and enjoy streaming.


## **Setting aspect ratio of video**
