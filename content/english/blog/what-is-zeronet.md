## What is ZeroNet?

It’s a Decentralized web platform using Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent network. Which provides open, free & uncensorable websites.


## Why ZeroNet?

1. Because it provides **Peer-to-Peer connectivity** without any central server and hence content is distributed directly to visitors.
2. **Uncensored** because its nowhere to be found.
3. **No hosting cost** as sites are served by visitors.
4. **Impossible to shutdown** as its nowhere yet everywhere.
5. **No point of failure** as the site will keep serving till the last peer serving.
6. **Fast and works offline** , it can be assessed without being online on the internet. As one can anytime view the sites being seeded by one.


## Why should one go for ZeroNet?

1. It provides **Real time site updating** with multiuser support.
2. Provides **.bit** Domains using namecoin **Cryptocurrency**.
3. **No Passwords** required as the account is protected by same cryptography technique as one’s **Bitcoin**.
4. **Fast** as the page response time is not limited by one’s connection speed.
5. **Works everywhere**, supports all modern browsers on **Linux, windows & Mac**.
6. **Provides Anonymity** as one can hide his **IP** using **Tor** Network.
7. **Opensource**, its developed by the community for the community.


## How Does it Work?

### The Basics of Asymmetric Cryptography

When i create a new site we get two keys -
```shell
	Private Key 5JNiiGspzqt8sL9FM54FMr53U9XvLVh8Waz6YYDK69gG6hso9xu

    Public key 16YsjZK9nweLyy3vNQQPKT8tfjCNjEX9JM
```

a) Private key

* Only **I have it**.
* It allows me to **sign new content** to the site.
* **No central registry**, it never leaves my computer. It don’t need to be published anywhere.
* **Impossible to modify** site without it.


b) Public key

* This is my **site’s address**.
* Using this anyone can **verify** that the content on the site is created by me (site owner).
* Every **downloaded file is verified** and hence makes it safe from malicious code’s insertion and modification.


## More info about Cryptography of ZeroNet

1. ZeroNet uses the same elliptic curve based **Encryption as in your Bitcoin wallet**.
2. You can **accept payments directly** to your site address.
3. It is estimated that even using fastest supercomputer available, it would take around **1 billion years to “HACK” a private key**.
