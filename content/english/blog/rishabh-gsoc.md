**Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2018** result was announced on April 23 at 09:30 PM.
I got selected for GSoC 2018 ðŸ˜Š in the organization [The Libreswan Project](https://libreswan.org/).
My project is [Web based Certificate and Profile User Interface](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5863013991579648).

I am really happy ðŸ˜Š, It means a lot to me.
Special thanks to **Manoj Kumar**, **Gurpreet Singh** and **Lokesh sharma**. These guys helped me a lot in making this possible by motivating and supporting me during the phase, also my family and friends who always encouraged me to go an extra mile and helped me in my bad times.
