Thousands of beautiful flowers,<br>
still can't overcome my scars.

New opportunities everyday,<br>
but can't forget the lost fray.

Going off with a beautiful smile,<br>
but who knows about the sorrows pile.

Love to see the happiness around,<br>
but is somehow limited by bounds.

Still hopeful what the life may bring,<br>
let me break the tied strings.
