When I saw her for the first time,<br>
She was wearing a white dress with a glittering shine.

She walked down the stairs with a flower in hand,<br>
And eyes started rolling on her with an ovational stand.

She was a princess with a pleasant smile,<br>
Which can even cure a wounded soldier in a while.

She was a perfect partner as I wanted,<br>
but I can’t take her as for granted,

She was perfect but not was I,<br>
That’s why I said her a very good bye<br>
A very good bye.......
