      <description>Its raining outside &amp;amp; i am writing this post , Hope it helps :-)
It was my 2nd year &amp;amp; SFD’s work was in progress &amp;amp; for that I’d been assigned a senior to work with &amp;amp; he was Arun Chaudhary (core coordinator of Team EXE) &amp;amp; believe me he was impressed with my work (what say Arun Sir? ;-) ) &amp;amp; he’d suggested me to join the team during nimbus(Tech fest of NIT Hamirpur) 2k16.</description>
