      <description>Previous post - GSoC - Initial phase and getting selected
First Evaluation I was very excited at the beginning of the project, as it is a whole new experience, especially for a student. So, I started working on the project in May. The starting was challenging as I choose Django as the framework which the project is going to be built on, I did so because it was most suitable as per the requirements of the project.</description>

      <description>Previous post - GSoC - Selecting the project and organization
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do. - Pele
Understanding the Project As I&amp;rsquo;ve already chosen my project (Read the previous post), It was time to know it better and work for it. So, I studied the details of the project form the organization wiki page and got an Idea of what this project is about.</description>

      <description>I started working towards GSoC 2018 in the first week of February. I remember because my birthday is in February and it was then I decided that I&amp;rsquo;ll try to be a part of GSoC 2018.
So, the first step in the process is the selection of a project/organization. Instead of selecting the organization I thought to go for a project of my interest, as in case of selecting an organization it is possible that the organization is doing something that interests us but their available projects don&amp;rsquo;t interest us much.</description>

      <description>The Basics of Asymmetric Cryptography  When i create a new site we get two keys -
Private Key 5JNiiGspzqt8sC8FM54FMr53U9XvL\ Vh8Waz6YYDK69gG6hso9xu Public key 16YsjZK9nweXyy3vNQ\ QPKT8tfjCNjEX9JM  a) Private key 5JNiiGspzqt8sC8FM54FMr53U9XvL
Vh8Waz6YYDK69gG6hso9xIu
 Only I have it. It allows me to sign new content to the site. No central registry, it never leaves my computer. It don‚Äôt need to be published anywhere. Impossible to modify site without it.  b) Public key 16YsjZK9nweXyy3vNQ</description>

      <description>What is ZeroNet?
It‚Äôs a Decentralized web platform using Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent network. Which provides open, free &amp;amp; uncensorable websites.
 Why ZeroNet?
   Because it provides Peer-to-Peer connectivity without any central server and hence content is distributed directly to visitors. Uncensored because its nowhere to be found. No hosting cost as sites are served by visitors. Impossible to shutdown as its nowhere yet everywhere. No point of failure as the site will keep serving till the last peer serving.</description>

      <description>You thought vlc as just another audio/video player, but to your surprise its much more than that. If you are using vlc you must be using it because its quite popular and maybe your friend recommended it to you as its a good player and if you ask him/her how its good then you must got in reply that it can play more formats of video than any other player can even think of.</description>

      <description>After 12th when i got admission in NIT Hamirpur, I came across few seniors who‚Äôre just great, then i discovered that they all had their websites which represents them on this World wide web. As i had the knowledge of html learn‚Äôt in 10 class and was very much impressed by its abilities, i thought of designing a website of my own. Before this me along with my few friends had tried designing and hosting of two unsuccessful sites (Photo-effects and Cyberbullying‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääunsuccessful because we left the development of these sites in between and deleted them after few months) and so this was my 3rd experiment with hosting and developing a site.</description>
