      <description>Previous post - GSoC - Initial phase and getting selected
First Evaluation I was very excited at the beginning of the project, as it is a whole new experience, especially for a student. So, I started working on the project in May. The starting was challenging as I choose Django as the framework which the project is going to be built on, I did so because it was most suitable as per the requirements of the project.</description>

      <description>Previous post - GSoC - Selecting the project and organization
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do. - Pele
Understanding the Project As I&amp;rsquo;ve already chosen my project (Read the previous post), It was time to know it better and work for it. So, I studied the details of the project form the organization wiki page and got an Idea of what this project is about.</description>

      <description>I started working towards GSoC 2018 in the first week of February. I remember because my birthday is in February and it was then I decided that I&amp;rsquo;ll try to be a part of GSoC 2018.
So, the first step in the process is the selection of a project/organization. Instead of selecting the organization I thought to go for a project of my interest, as in case of selecting an organization it is possible that the organization is doing something that interests us but their available projects don&amp;rsquo;t interest us much.</description>
