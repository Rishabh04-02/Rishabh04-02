      <description>On February 5 I started working towards GSOC 2018. I remember the date because my birthday is on 4th February and it was the day I decided that I&amp;rsquo;ll try to be a part of GSOC 2018.
So, the first step in the process is the selection of a project/organization. Instead of selecting the organization I thought to go for a project of my interest, as in case of selecting an organization it is possible that the organization is doing something that interests us but their available projects don&amp;rsquo;t interests us much.</description>
