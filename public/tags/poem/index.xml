      <description>It all started with a pleasant smile,
which left its imprint for a while.
Then came the part of introduction,
which lasted longer than the usual deduction.
Our meetings started getting long and cosy,
little did we know that it&amp;rsquo;s going to be rosy.
The realization of it being love wasn&amp;rsquo;t late,
and for us, it was quite an elate.
With all this being told, let&amp;rsquo;s see where it goes,</description>

      <description>  See you soon,
even if that means passing through dunes.
You are one of my dearest friends,
for whom I pray, her happiness ascends.
You are one of the finest persons in my life,
whom I never want to see in strife.
You are the one inspiring girl,
who one day will surely shine like a pearl.

      <description>I am not a good listener,
but want to listen to you for hours.
I am not humorous,
but want to make you laugh.
I am not good at time management,
but want to spend time with you.
I am not intelligent,
but want to solve complex problems, with you.
I am not good at expressing feelings,
but still want to share them with you.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why,</description>

      <title>Beautiful flowers</title>

      <description> Thousands of beautiful flowers,
still can&amp;rsquo;t overcome my scars.
New opportunities everyday,
but can&amp;rsquo;t forget the lost fray.
Going off with a beautiful smile,
but who knows about the sorrows pile.
Love to see the happiness around,
but is somehow limited by bounds.
Still hopeful what the life may bring,
let me break the tied strings.

      <title>Being Misunderstood</title>

      <description>Being misunderstood has become a part of my life,
people here will judge you on the base of strife.
Life has changed a lot,
like a growing money-plant in a pot.
Once a happy soul,
is now a hated ghoul.
No, one wants to be in your shoes,
but everyone wants to get you blues.
Trying hard to find the meaning of life’s valley,
but at every step being cheated by some ally.</description>

      <title>The Girl I Loved</title>

      <description>The girl I loved the most,
Left me at the coast.
She said she don’t want to continue,
To which shocked, I said k… I don’t want to burden you.
She was happy I don’t know why,
But for me it was hard to cry.

 The coast grew silent &amp;amp; so did I,
But she was somehow smiling with joy.
The happy moments come to my mind,</description>

      <title>A Proposal Unaccepted</title>

      <description>Loving a girl was pretty fine,
As it gave me an experience like drinking wine.
She was like a princess and I was like a slave,
And falling for her may be leading me to my grave.
Even though I proposed her as I loved her a lot,
To which she even does not give a second thought.
She started ignoring me as like I am a rotten apple,</description>

      <description>When I saw her for the first time,
She was wearing a white dress with a glittering shine.
She walked down the stairs with a flower in hand,
And eyes started rolling on her with an ovational stand.
She was a princess with a pleasant smile,
Which can even cure a wounded soldier in a while.
She was a perfect partner as I wanted,
but I can’t take her as for granted,</description>
