      <description> Thousands of beautiful flowers,
still can&amp;rsquo;t overcome my scars.
New opportunities everyday,
but can&amp;rsquo;t forget the lost fray.
Going off with a beautiful smile,
but who knows about the sorrows pile.
Love to see the happiness around,
but is somehow limited by bounds.
Still hopeful what the life may bring,
let me break the tied strings.

      <title>Being Misunderstood</title>

      <description>Being misunderstood has become a part of my life,
people here will judge you on the base of strife.
Life has changed a lot,
like a growing money-plant in a pot.
Once a happy soul,
is now a hated ghoul.
No, one wants to be in your shoes,
but everyone wants to get you blues.
Trying hard to find the meaning of life’s valley,
but at every step being cheated by some ally.</description>

      <description>The girl I loved the most,
Left me at the coast,
She said she don’t want to continue,
To which shocked, I said k… I don’t want to burden you,
She was happy I don’t know why,
But for me it was hard to cry.

 The coast grew silent &amp;amp; so did I,
But she was somehow smiling with joy,
The happy moments come to my mind,</description>

      <title>A Proposal Unaccepted</title>

      <description>Loving a girl was pretty fine,
As it gave me an experience like drinking wine.
She was like a princess and I was like a slave,
And falling for her may be leading me to my grave.
Even though I proposed her as I loved her a lot,
To which she even does not give a second thought.
She started ignoring me as like I am a rotten apple,</description>

      <description>When I saw her for the first time,
She was wearing a white dress with a glittering shine.
She walked down the stairs with a flower in hand,
And eyes started rolling on her with an ovational stand.
She was a princess with a pleasant smile,
Which can even cure a wounded soldier in a while.
She was a perfect partner as I wanted but I can’t take her as for granted,</description>
