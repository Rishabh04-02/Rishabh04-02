      <description>Those were the summer vacations when everybody was experiencing boredom at its best. And i was also one of those and was thinking on “The ways to kill boredom?”, when i came to know that my family has already planned a trip out to Shillong and i wasn’t even informed about this trip (It was a surprise for me) and i really liked it (oh! sorry Loved it).
 How we reached there?</description>
