<p><img src="https://rishabhchaudhary.in/gsoc-logo.svg" width="50%"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>GSoC 2019, Bash(Shell Scripting), NSS database, Lets Encrypt, Certbot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Created shell scripts for establishing the Opportunistic Encryption connection using Libreswan IPsec. It also generates client/server configurations and updates and imports the certificates automatically along with handling files safely. Server/Client crashes handled. The project makes the process of using OE easier, automated and over 10 times faster than the manual procedure.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Opportunistic IPsec is an attempt to encrypt the internet at large. The idea is to build VPN tunnels directly to all internet hosts irrespective of the communication used. An initial proof of concept was created that leverages LetsEncrypt certificates for use with IKE and IPsec. The goal of this project is to turn this proof of concept into production quality code that makes it trivial to enrol and deploy on any server and any client.</p>

<p>The project has the following objectives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automate Client, Server configuration and the enrollment and updating of LetsEncrypt certificates for use with libreswan.</li>
<li>Implement a DNS/DNSSEC based method for advertising Opportunistic IPsec support using LetsEncrypt for servers.</li>
<li>Design a non-DNS based method for publishing support of LetsEncrypt based Opportunistic IPsec for servers.</li>
<li>Enhance libreswan to allow a secure fallback to the existing NULL Authentication method.</li>
<li>Ensure the working of two behind the same NAT. Along with ensuring the working of two clients behind NAT, with one not using IPsec.</li>
<li>Support the recovery from server OR client reboot/crashes. Along with ensuring no lockouts happen.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>GSoC 2018, Django 2.0, Python 3.5, MySQL, HTML-CSS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Developed Application for generating &amp; signing CA root certificates &amp; user certificates (VPN connection profiles) along with generating custom configurations for user certificates. Automatic creating and updating of certificate revocation list implemented. The project increased the efficiency of performing all the above tasks by over 7 times as compared to the existing manual procedure.</p>

<h3 id="background-1">Background</h3>

<p>There   are   shell   scripts   for   creating   X.509   certificates,   revoking   certificates   and  signing   CRLs   and   scripts   for   the   creation   of   Profile   certificate   files   for   certain  devices   such   as   Linux,   Apple   OS   X,   Windows,   iOS,   etc.,   these   require   careful  specification   of   various   certificate   attributes   so   that   these   certificates   work   on   a  variety   of   devices:   Android,   Windows,   iOS/OSX,   Linux,   etc.   The   goal   of   this   project  is to gather all that knowledge into a simple interface.</p>

<p>The interface supports the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generating   the   proper   ipsec.conf   configuration   based   on   web   admin  interface including DNS/split-DNS configurations.</li>
<li>Allow Administrator to invite new users using email id.</li>
<li>A   new   user   after   account   validation   can   download   the   generated  certificate/profile (over TLS) for different platforms.</li>
<li>The   generated   certificates/profiles   can   only   be   downloaded   once,   through  the portal.</li>
<li>Admin   can   list,   revoke/disable   (temporary   revocation)   user  certificates/profiles.</li>
<li>Generate PKCS#12​ certificates for users.</li>
<li>Generate   iOS/OSX   ​ .mobileconfig   profiles   for   automatic   installation   on  iOS/OSX.</li>
<li>Ipsilon user authentication to web application.</li>
<li>Configure munin-node to work with libreswan plugin.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Python, Sockets, GPG (GNU Privacy Guard), Linux, Broadcasting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Allowing the system administrators to perform different tasks parallelly on 100’s of the client systems. It has error detection and correction functionality, along with providing real-time support for clients. The payload sending is secured with PGP key encryption. This project increases the efficiency of performing the above tasks by over 30 times as compared to the manual procedure.</p>

<h2 id="background-2">Background</h2>

<p>This project is Developed and submitted (as Major Project II) in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of the degree of Bachelor of Technology and is the continuation of project: Agent using client server Interaction.</p>

<p>This project named Linux based secure systems manager, is an open source software. It allows the system administrator to perform various tasks on the client systems connected on a network with just firing a command eg. installation of softwares, upgrading system, shutting down the systems, which then performs/executes the desired tasks on all the systems. Also, it allows various users on a network/subnet to chat in a dedicated chat room. This software can easily adapt to large network of computers and works efficiently for small networks.</p>

<p>This software can be used in any computers connected to a single network with Linux as the operating system like a computer laboratory. The only constraint is that they all must run Linux as their operating system with python and Thefuck (package) installed along with few modules of python eg. python3-tkinter. The project uses the package Thefuck for error correction. The client scripts can be installed using !bangs in Linux.</p>

<p>Thefuck for error handling and error correction tries to match a rule for the previous command, creates a new command using the matched rule and runs the corrected command. Moreover, we can also create our own rule for the package and in that way it’ll become more effective and efficient according to our needs. Also the error correction package we are using is open source and hence is under rapid development phase and also its available for all available major operating systems.</p>

<p>Built an application for the online allotment of various UG/PG electives, which are allotted based on CGPA, elective priority &amp; available seats. The software has an auto backup mechanism and is using SQL procedures for performing various tasks. The project has proved to be over 15 times faster than the existing system (manual).</p>

<h3 id="background-4">Background</h3>

<p>This project named Elective Manager, is an open source project. It will be used to allot the Elective subjects to undergraduate as well as post-graduate students. These elective subjects are published by the departments and are allotted to students based
on their priority of published subjects and CGPA. The system can adapt to a range of events from small scale to large scale.</p>

<p>Previously, the allotment of the elective subjects was done manually which was a very inconvenient method for the students as well as for the teachers. The allotment process was very chaotic and time consuming.
The Prime objective of this project is to automate the process of allotment thus allotting the elective subjects without chaos and in a more convenient manner to the people involved.</p>
