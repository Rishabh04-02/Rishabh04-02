      <description>Google Summer of Code(GSOC) 2018 result was announced on April 23 at 09:30PM. I got selected for GSOC 2018 in organization The Libreswan Project. My project is Web based Certificate and Profile User Interface.
I am really happy, It means a lot to me. Special thanks to Manoj Kumar (The motivator), Gurpreet singh and Lokesh sharma . These guys helped me a lot in making this possible and also my family and friends who always encouraged and helped me in my bad times.</description>
