      <description>Being misunderstood has become a part of my life,
people here will judge you on the base of strife.
Life has changed a lot,
like a growing money-plant in a pot.
Once a happy soul,
is now a hated ghoul.
No, one wants to be in your shoes,
but everyone wants to get you blues.
Trying hard to find the meaning of life’s valley,
but at every step being cheated by some ally.</description>

      <description>The girl I loved the most,
Left me at the coast,
She said she don’t want to continue,
To which shocked, I said k… I don’t want to burden you,
She was happy I don’t know why,
But for me it was hard to cry.
The coast grew silent &amp;amp; so did I,
But she was somehow smiling with joy,
The happy moments come to my mind,
When I saw in her eyes who was never mine.</description>

      <description>When I saw her for the first time,
She was wearing a white dress with a glittering shine.
She walked down the stairs with a flower in hand,
And eyes started rolling on her with an ovational stand.
She was a princess with a pleasant smile,
Which can even cure a wounded soldier in a while.
She was a perfect partner as I wanted but I can’t take her as for granted,</description>
