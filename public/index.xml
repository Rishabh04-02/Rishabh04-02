      <title>Being Misunderstood</title>

      <description>Being misunderstood has become a part of my life,
people here will judge you on the base of strife.
Life has changed a lot,
like a growing money-plant in a pot.
Once a happy soul,
is now a hated ghoul.
No, one wants to be in your shoes,
but everyone wants to get you blues.
Trying hard to find the meaning of life’s valley,
but at every step being cheated by some ally.</description>

      <description>You thought vlc as just another audio/video player, but to your surprise its much more than that. If you are using vlc you must be using it because its quite popular and maybe your friend recommended it to you as its a good player and if you ask him/her how its good then you must got in reply that it can play more formats of video than any other player can even think of.</description>

      <title>The Girl I Loved</title>

      <description>The girl I loved the most,
Left me at the coast,
She said she don’t want to continue,
To which shocked, I said k… I don’t want to burden you,
She was happy I don’t know why,
But for me it was hard to cry.

 The coast grew silent &amp;amp; so did I,
But she was somehow smiling with joy,
The happy moments come to my mind,</description>

      <title>A Proposal Unaccepted</title>

      <description>Loving a girl was pretty fine,
As it gave me an experience like drinking wine.
She was like a princess and I was like a slave,
And falling for her may be leading me to my grave.
Even though I proposed her as I loved her a lot,
To which she even does not give a second thought.
She started ignoring me as like I am a rotten apple,</description>

      <description>After 12th when i got admission in NIT Hamirpur, I came across few seniors who’re just great, then i discovered that they all had their websites which represents them on this World wide web. As i had the knowledge of html learn’t in 10 class and was very much impressed by its abilities, i thought of designing a website of my own. Before this me along with my few friends had tried designing and hosting of two unsuccessful sites (Photo-effects and Cyberbullying — unsuccessful because we left the development of these sites in between and deleted them after few months) and so this was my 3rd experiment with hosting and developing a site.</description>

      <description>When I saw her for the first time,
She was wearing a white dress with a glittering shine.
She walked down the stairs with a flower in hand,
And eyes started rolling on her with an ovational stand.
She was a princess with a pleasant smile,
Which can even cure a wounded soldier in a while.
She was a perfect partner as I wanted but I can’t take her as for granted,</description>
